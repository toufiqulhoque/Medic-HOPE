                    <p className='about-p'>Hope was at the forefront of modern medicine when it was first organized as a multi-specialty group practice in 1921. From a small outpatient clinic, it has grown to become the world’s first integrated international health system. With more than 65,000 caregivers worldwide, Hope has almost 6 million patient visits per year, at more than 200 locations.
